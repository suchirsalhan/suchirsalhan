### Hi! 👋

I'm Suchir, a Finalist at the University of Cambridge specialising in Natural Language Processing. 

🔭 I'm currently working on applying Linguistic Theory to improve the cross-linguistic capabilities of Transformer-based Language Models with Dr Andrew Caines. You can find my research on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Suchir-Salhan) or on [Academia](https://independent.academia.edu/SuchirSalhan).

🤝 I've had the chance to work on some interesting projects on probing multimodal language models in the [Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/) with Prof Nigel Collier and Fangyu Liu. I've worked on argumentation mining in the  [ALTA Institute](http://www.wiki.cl.cam.ac.uk/clwiki/NaturalLanguage/ALTA) and the [NLIP Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/). I've also assisted research on corpus-based studies of code-switching. 

🌱 I'm increasingly interested in learning about Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

📫 Feel free to [contact me](mailto:sas245@cam.ac.uk)!
