### Hi, I'm Suchir 👋🏼

I'm a Machine Learning PhD Candidate at the University of Cambridge, working on Natural Language Processing. 

- 🎓 I completed my BA and MEng at the University of Cambridge (Gonville & Caius College). 
- 💼 I've worked on offline Imitation Learning, XAI, multimodal language models, argumentation mining, and applying Linguistic Theory to improve the cross-linguistic capabilities of Transformer-based Language Models
- 💬 I have a highly interdisciplinary background, with interests in cognitive science (e.g., language acquisition and comparative cognition), Linguistics (language typology) and journalism.
